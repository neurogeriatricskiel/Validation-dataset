# Validation-dataset
First few participants from a full-body dataset with inertial measurement units (IMUs) and optical motion capture data.

This is a mobility dataset for the development and validation of IMU-based algorithms. The dataset contains several walking trials, clinical assessments and daily living activities performed in the lab. Healthy participants as well as neurological patients (Parkinson's disease, Multiple sclerosis, stroke, chronic low back pain) will be included in the dataset. The data collection is ongoing. In the data folder you find the data of the first 10 participants (some of the larger files are missing, since they were too large to be uploaded), more data can be made available on request.

The data of the first five healthy young adults (18-60 years; pp001-pp005) and the first five healthy older adults (>60 years; pp006-pp010) are made available. Each participant folder contains the data of the IMUs and the optical motion capture system in seperate folders.

Information about the IMU and marker placement as well as the performed assessments can be found in the study protocol paper (https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/21/17/5833).
