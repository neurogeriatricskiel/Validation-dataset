# Validation-dataset
First few participants from a full-body dataset with inertial measurement units (IMUs) and optical motion capture data.

This is a mobility dataset for the development and validation of IMU-based algorithms. The dataset contains several walking trials, clinical assessments and daily living activities performed in the lab. Healthy participants as well as neurological patients (Parkinson's disease, Multiple sclerosis, stroke, chronic low back pain) will be included in the dataset. The data collection is ongoing. Here are the data of the first 10 participants, more data can be made available on request during the data collection phase.

The data folder contains the data of the first five healthy young adults (18-60 years; pp001-pp005) and the first five healthy older adults (>60 years; pp006-pp010). Each participant folder contains the data of the IMUs and the optical motion capture system in seperate folders.
More information will follow soon.
